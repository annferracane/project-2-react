# Phase 2 Project - React (Ann Ferracane & Wendy Yeung) - XKCD Comics

## Requirements Completed

This project uses jokes from xkcd.com API and stores them locally in a db.json file.

This app:

-- is a single page application.

-- includes 11 components (including App.js).

-- includes 4 client-side routes: / , /favorites , /comic/:id , and /new

-- uses a json-server and includes: GET, POST, and PATCH requests

-- implemented Boostrap (https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Stretch Goals

We used useHistory, useRef, and useParams (along with useState). We also implemented bootstrap. 


## Functionality

Users should see a list of 10 comics when they route load the application. They can favorite these comics, they can click them to see more detail about the comic, and they can comment on each commic (and delete comments). Users can also add new comics. 


## Contributing

Commments certainly welcome. Again, this project is for the purpose of our own learning.
