# Phase 2 Project - React (Ann Ferracane & Wendy Yeung) - XKCD Comics

## Requirements Completed

This project uses jokes from xkcd.com API and stores them locally in a db.json file.

This app:

-- is a single page application.

-- includes 11 components (including App.js).

-- includes 4 client-side routes: / , /favorites , /comic/:id , and /new

-- uses a json-server and includes: GET, POST, and PATCH requests

-- implemented Boostrap (https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Stretch Goals

We used useHistory, useRef, and useParams (along with useState). We also implemented bootstrap. 


## Functionality

Users should see a list of 10 comics when they route load the application. They can favorite these comics, they can click them to see more detail about the comic, and they can comment on each commic (and delete comments). Users can also add new comics. 

## Challenges

The main challenge I faced in building this app was with regard to async fetching. In some cases, if you click "Delete Jokes" or "Add Jokes" the local db.json server will refuse the connection and this will show up in the fetch catch. In speaking to instructor David W, I learned that this is a good learning in that this issue would not be a concern if this app was built with React (which is later in our course). While we could have possibly solved this with async functions and "wait" (and I did attempt to do so), it was not necessary to solve for the purpose this project (and, as such, now serves as a good learning).

## Contributing

Commments certainly welcome. Again, this project is for the purpose of my own learning.
